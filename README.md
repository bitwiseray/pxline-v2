## Full-Stack Chat App (Beta)

This is a **hobbyist** project for a full-stack chat application built by very "professional and experienced devs" using Node.js, Express.js framework, and Ejs for front-end templating, and the most important on **Android devices**!

### Note

- **User Authentication**: Securely sign up and log in to access the chat features.
- **User Profiles**: Customize your profile with a username and avatar.

### Technologies Used

- **Express.js**: For framework.
- **Ejs**: For front-end templating.
