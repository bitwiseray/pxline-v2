## Full-Stack Chat App (Beta)
This is a **hobbyist** project for a full-stack chat application built by very "professional and experienced devs" using Node.js, the Express.js framework, and EJS for minor front-end templating, and finally, project started off and was first created on **Android devices**!

### Note
All claimed features may not be available or only halfway done, instability & bugs are expected until this note is removed.

  <summary>Why?</summary>
  This is an hobbyist project as well as an very large one, so we will focus on adding all the claimed features before focusing on stability and bugs fixing.
