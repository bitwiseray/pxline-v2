## Full-Stack Chat App: PxLine (Deprecate)
Check [this](https://github.com/bitwiseray/pxline-nova/) instead
This is a **hobbyist** project for a full-stack chat application built by very 'professional and experienced devs' using Node.js, the Express.js framework, and of course, vanilla web! 
The project was first started on Android devices!

### Note
All claimed features may not be available or may be only halfway done. Instability and bugs are expected until this note is removed.

  <summary>Why?</summary>
  This is a hobbyist project as well as a very large one, so we will focus on adding all the claimed features before focusing on stability and bug fixing.
