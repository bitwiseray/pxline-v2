## Full-Stack Chat App: PxLine (Early)
This is a **hobbyist** project for a full-stack chat application built by very "professional and experienced devs" using Node.js, the Express.js framework, and EJS for minor front-end templating. The project was first created on **Android devices**!

### Note
All claimed features may not be available or may be only halfway done. Instability and bugs are expected until this note is removed.

  <summary>Why?</summary>
